# Node Management System

Focusing on building a robust system to register, monitor, and manage nodes.

## Node Management Workflow

* **Node Registration:** Each node registers itself with the cluster when it starts.
* **Heartbeat Mechanism:** Nodes send periodic health checks to the cluster manager or peers.
* **Failure Detection:** Identify and mark failed nodes.
* **Metadata Management:** Maintain a dynamic list of active nodes.
* **Rebalancing Trigger:** Respond to node addition or removal.

## Components to Implement (Current Scope)

### Node Metadata

* Store information about each node (e.g., ID, IP, status, capacity).
* Use an in-memory database (e.g., Redis) or a distributed store (e.g., etcd).

### Node Registration API

* Nodes register themselves with the cluster manager.
* Store metadata in the metadata store.

### Health Monitoring

* Nodes periodically send heartbeats to report their status. If a node misses multiple heartbeats, it is marked as failed.

### Rebalancing

* Tasks/data are automatically redistributed when a node is added or removed.

## Future Scope

* **Rebalancing:** Implement data redistribution logic on node failure.
* **UI/CLI:** Create a tool to visualize and manage nodes.
