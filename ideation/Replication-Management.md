# Replication Manager System

**Replica Manager** is responsible for managing the replication of data across nodes to ensure fault tolerance and high availability. Here's how you can build it step by step

## **Replica Manager Workflow**

* **Data Placement**: Decide which nodes will store replicas of the data.
* **Replication Factor**: Define the number of replicas for each object.
* **Consistency**: Ensure all replicas of an object are consistent during updates.
* **Re-replication**: Handle node failures by replicating data to other healthy nodes.
* **Metadata Management**: Track which nodes hold replicas of each object.

## **Components to Implement Replica**

* **Metadata Store**: Maintain metadata about replicas (e.g., object ID, replica locations). Use an in-memory store or distributed database for this purpose.

* **Replication Placement Algorithm**: Distribute replicas across nodes based on rules (e.g., load balancing, proximity).

* **Replication API**: This allows clients to upload objects, which are then replicated across nodes. Consistency Protocols: Implement synchronous or asynchronous replication.

* **Re-replication Logic**: Detect missing replicas due to node failures and create new replicas.

## **Future Scope**

* **Optimized Placement**: Use a consistent hashing algorithm for better replica distribution.
* **Asynchronous Replication**: Support asynchronous replica updates to improve performance.
